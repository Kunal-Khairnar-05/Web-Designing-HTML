        <h1>Neymar JR : The king of dribbling skills </h1>
    </div> <br>
    <p style="text-transform: capitalize; word-spacing: 7px;background-color:yellow;border:3px ridge black;">Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior (born 5 February 1992),
        known as Neymar, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris
        Saint-Germain and the Brazil national team. He is widely regarded as one of the best players in the world.Neymar
        came into prominence at Santos, where he made his professional debut aged 17. He helped the club win two
        successive Campeonato Paulista championships, a Copa do Brasil, and the 2011 Copa Libertadores; the latter being
        Santos' first since 1963. Neymar was twice named the South American Footballer of the Year, in 2011 and 2012,
        and soon relocated to Europe to join Barcelona. As part of Barcelona's attacking trio with Lionel Messi and Luis
        Suárez, he won the continental treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League, and finished
        third for the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2015 for his performances. He then attained a domestic double in the 2015–16
        season. In 2017, Neymar transferred to Paris Saint-Germain in a move worth €222 million, making him the most
        expensive player ever. In France, Neymar won three league titles, three Coupe de France, and two Coupe de la
        Ligue, which included a domestic treble and being voted Ligue 1 Player of the Year in his debut season. Neymar
        helped PSG attain a domestic quadruple in the 2019–20 season, and led the club to its first ever Champions
        League Final.With 70 goals in 116 matches for Brazil since debuting at age 18, Neymar is the second highest
        goalscorer for his national team, trailing Pelé. He was a key player in Brazil's victories at the 2011 South
        American Youth Championship, where he finished as leading goalscorer, and the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup,
        where he won the Golden Ball. His participation in the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2015 Copa América was cut short
        by injury and a suspension, respectively, before captaining Brazil to their first Olympic gold medal in men's
        football at the 2016 Summer Olympics. Having renounced the captaincy, he featured at the 2018 FIFA World Cup,
        and after missing the 2019 Copa América through injury, helped Brazil to a runner-up finish at the 2021
        tournament.Off the pitch, Neymar ranks among the world's most prominent sportsmen. SportsPro named him the most
        marketable athlete in the world in 2012 and 2013, and ESPN cited him as the world's fourth-most famous athlete
        in 2016. In 2017, Time included him in its annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world. In 2018,
        France Football ranked Neymar the world's third highest-paid footballer. The following year, Forbes ranked him
        the world's third highest-paid athlete, dropping a spot to fourth in 2020.</p>

            <h1>Early life</h1>
        </div>
    <p style="text-indent: 20%;background-color:grey;color:white;border:3px ridge black;">
        Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior was born in Mogi das Cruzes, São Paulo, to Neymar Santos Sr. and Nadine da
            Silva. He inherited his name from his father, who is a former footballer and became his son's advisor
        as Neymar's talents began to grow. Neymar comments on his father's role: "My father has been by my side since I
        was little. He takes care of things, my finances and my family." Growing up, Neymar combined his love of futsal
        with street football. Neymar said that futsal had a massive influence on him growing up, helping him develop his
        technique, speed of thought and ability to perform moves in tight spaces.<br>

        <h1>International career</h1>
    </div>
    <p style="text-transform: capitalize;background-color:pink;border:3px ridge black;">Following Neymar's performances for Santos in their successful early 2010
        season, including winning the 2010 Copa do Brasil, in which Neymar was the top goalscorer, and the 2010
        Campeonato Paulista, in which Neymar scored 14 goals, former Brazilian football players Pelé and Romário
        reportedly urged coach Dunga to take Neymar to the 2010 World Cup. Although the widespread opinion that Neymar
        deserved a place in Dunga's squad went as far as a 14,000 signature petition, and despite the huge pressure on
        Dunga to pick Neymar, he was omitted from both the squad of 23, and the stand-by list. Although Dunga described
        Neymar as "extremely talented", he claimed that he had not been tested sufficiently on the international level
        to earn a World Cup spot and he had failed to impress enough while on international duty.</p>

        <h1>Personal life</h1>

        serve Christ! Neymar reportedly also tithes (10%) his income to his church and has named Kaká as his religious
        role model. Each year, Neymar organises a charity match with fellow Brazilian footballer Nenê in Nenê's hometown
        of Jundiaí, with the purpose of raising food for needy families. In addition to his native Portuguese, Neymar
        also speaks Spanish.

        for the second consecutive year. He topped the list ahead of Lionel Messi, Rory McIlroy, Usain Bolt and

        domestic markets, the charisma and their market potential in the next three years. In March 2015, Neymar had the
        fourth highest social media rank in the world among sportspeople, behind Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and
        David Beckham, with 52 million Facebook fans. He has over 150 million Instagram followers, the third highest for
